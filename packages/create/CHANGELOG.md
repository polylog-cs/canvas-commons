# Change Log

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#115](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/pull/115)
  [`c59b2c8`](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/commit/c59b2c834df83d4e47f7140f019365b31d7e4887)
  Thanks [@hhenrichsen](https://github.com/hhenrichsen)! - declare kleur as a
  direct dependency so scaffolding works under pnpm's strict node_modules layout
  instead of relying on npm hoisting it from prompts.

## 0.3.1

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#100](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/pull/100)
  [`6a5c29e`](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/commit/6a5c29e4d12d3e4d1811cf290e5907246d686b0f)
  Thanks [@hhenrichsen](https://github.com/hhenrichsen)! - Moved
  motion-canvas.d.ts to canvas-commons.d.ts

- [#95](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/pull/95)
  [`9ceea2c`](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/commit/9ceea2c597de8270cdd0ce45ae48fa910f8c40cf)
  Thanks [@hhenrichsen](https://github.com/hhenrichsen)! - Treat
  `@canvas-commons/ffmpeg` version placeholder the same as the
  `core`/`2d`/`editor`/`vite-plugin` versions are handled.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#69](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/pull/69)
  [`0978c35`](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/commit/0978c35c04a5154ab2c48a94fc48d31f0ecdb47d)
  Thanks [@hhenrichsen](https://github.com/hhenrichsen)! - fix(create): include
  template directories in the published tarball

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/pull/59)
  [`dc986d0`](https://github.com/canvas-commons/canvas-commons/commit/dc986d05c85ac203d46e3bfd82735cf896cd29cb)
  Thanks [@hhenrichsen](https://github.com/hhenrichsen)! - Modernize packaging,
  build, and release pipeline.
  - Closes the public API surface with explicit `exports` maps. Each package
    ships a single root entry (`.`) plus only the subpaths that genuinely need
    to be separate: `@canvas-commons/2d/{jsx-runtime,jsx-dev-runtime,editor}`,
    `@canvas-commons/ffmpeg/{client,server}`, `@canvas-commons/core/shaders/*`
    (for `#include` directives in user shaders), and the standard file exports
    (`./project`, `./tsconfig.project.json`, `./package.json`). Previously
    available subpaths like `@canvas-commons/core/scenes`,
    `@canvas-commons/2d/components`, etc. are gone — re-import the same symbols
    from the root entry. The packages are `sideEffects: false`, so tree-shaking
    removes anything you don't use.
  - Drops Lerna for pnpm workspaces + Changesets.
  - Bumps `engines.node` floor to `>=20.19.0`.
  - `@canvas-commons/vite-plugin` peerDep range broadened to
    `^4 || ^5 || ^7 || ^8`. The editor, player, template, and examples now build
    against Vite 8 (Rolldown-backed) by default, with Vitest 4 driving unit and
    end-to-end tests. The plugin emits Vite 8's `oxc.jsx` configuration in place
    of the deprecated `esbuild.jsx*` keys, resolves project entries to absolute
    paths so they survive resolution from virtual modules, and looks up the
    editor package from the consumer's cwd so pnpm's strict layout finds it.
  - `@canvas-commons/editor`'s library build now emits its CSS as `style.css` to
    match the `./style.css` export. Vite 8's library mode renamed the default
    CSS output, so the explicit `cssFileName: 'style'` keeps the
    consumer-visible filename stable.
  - `LogPayload.remarks` is markdown source now, not pre-rendered HTML. The
    canvas-commons editor renders it at display time; consumers that read
    `remarks` directly should pass it through a markdown parser like `marked`.
  - Library builds (`core`, `2d`, `vite-plugin`, `ffmpeg`) migrated from `tsc`
    to `tsdown` (Rolldown-based) and emit a bundled single-file `lib/index.js`
    to match the single-entry `exports` map. Published output is still ESM with
    `.d.ts` declarations and source maps.
  - `core` and `2d` no longer ship a separate `bundle` script. The regular build
    produces both the library (`lib/index.js`) and the minified single-file
    bundle (`dist/index.js`) used by the in-browser docs examples.
  - `@canvas-commons/ui` renamed to `@canvas-commons/editor`. Update your
    `package.json` deps and any imports. The package shape, exports map, and
    `./style.css` subpath are unchanged.
  - Upgrades Docusaurus to v3, enables future v4 changes, and migrates to
    React 18.

  Pre-1.0, so this ships as a minor across the linked `core`+`2d` group and the
  rest of the publishable packages.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- remove legacy package
- change to import paths

See
[the migration guide](https://motion-canvas.github.io/guides/migration/12.0.0)
for more info.

- change the way scenes are imported

Scene files no longer need to follow the pattern: `[name].scene.tsx`. When
importing scenes in the project file, a dedicated `?scene` query param should be
used:

```ts
import example from './scenes/example?scene';

export default new Project({
  name: 'project',
  scenes: [example],
});
```
